# Transfer Learning with TensorFlow.js

This directory contains a project that demonstrates how to use transfer learning
with TensorFlow.js. It's a port of the demo from the TensorFlow.js website:
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/tensorflowjs-transfer-learning-teachable-machine
over to running using Deno and the Fresh framework.

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary. More
instructions to follow.
